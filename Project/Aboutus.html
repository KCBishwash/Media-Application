                <h1>About us</h1>
                <p>Experience Nepal has come a long way since its humble beginnings in 1989. A company that began with two bearded backpackers, a typewriter and a kitchen table now leads 100,000 travellers across the globe each year.
                And although we're a bit larger these days - with 1,000 staff based around the world and over 800 different trips across every continent (not to mention multiple kitchen tables) - our mission remains the same. We still get a kick out of responsible travel, small groups and very (very) big adventures.</p>
                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>The year was 1988. While most of the world wasted their time dreaming of hoverboard-mounted lasers, joining wild pyramid schemes and listening to Milli Vanilli, two mates from Melbourne spurned these distractions and instead turned their youthful, entrepreneurial beards toward the thing they loved the most - travel. 
                Darrell and Manch were their names and adventuring was - lucky for us - their game.
                Perhaps inspired by the impending release of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the pair decided to up the ante on their adventuring and set off for the wilds of Africa. 
                Forgoing the comfort of an air-conditioned bus, they modified an ex-council truck and crammed it with friends, supplies, a handful of aviator sunglasses and a case or two of beer. It was to be the greatest road trip since Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, which had come out a few months earlier.
                At some point during the trip, Darrell and Manch took off their flap-back sunhats and put on their world-changing sombreros.<a href="index2.html"> Read more...</a></p>
